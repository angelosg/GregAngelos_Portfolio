# Data Science Portfolio

# [Project 1: NLP project that classifies philosophers based on essays and generates text](https://github.com/angelosg/Philospher-project)
Using this [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christopherlemke/philosophical-texts?resource=download), I endeavored to fine tune a model that would allow us to use transformers for text generation of random philosophical tautology in the style of a particular philosopher.

In this data set there have access to quotes from 5 historical philosphers, each with distinct styles of writing and subjects. They are Aristotle, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche, and Plato.

I have also used Naive-Bayes classification to classify each sentence into each philosopher category with almost 90% accuracy.

# [Project 2: Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/angelosg/Heart-Disease-Project)
This project demonstrates machine learning methods and helps find predictors for heart disease. 

Explanation of data source

Data source is from Kaggle.com at the following URL for [Heart Data](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)

The data is for 912 patients in four different countries and assesses the risk of a heart attack with basic health information. This project will use ML and EDA to try and determine the most important risk factors for heart disease and a potential heart attack.

# [Project 3: Lawler's Law predictor for basketball game winner](https://github.com/angelosg/Lawler-s-law)
This project was a dive into machine learning methods by looking at Lawler's law. Lawler's law states that the first team to score 100 points in an NBA basketball game will win the game. I have looked at several factors like higher scoring games in today's game reducing effectiveness of Lawler's law prediction.

I have performed some EDA and a couple machine learning models including random forest and decision trees.

# [Project 4: PhD Thesis summary](https://github.com/angelosg/Thesis)
This project is a summary of my PhD thesis. It introduces the abstract and provides a link to my thesis document.
